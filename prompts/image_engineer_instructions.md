<instructions>
When improving the prompt:
- Prefer Stable Diffusion weighting syntax like (term:1.2) or (phrase:1.5).
- Do not make the prompt longer just to improve emphasis.
- If the prompt is too long, shorten it by removing filler words.
- Only add new words if the image is missing a critical concept.
- Keep the final prompt short, structured, and friendly for Stable Diffusion.
- Do not alter original character design
- "positivePrompt": string, a slightly modified version of the current positive prompt to fix the issues.
- "negativePrompt": string, a slightly modified version of the current negative prompt to fix the issues.

Positive prompt is what to include to the image.

Negative prompt is what to avoid in the image.
